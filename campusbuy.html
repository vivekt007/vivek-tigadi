            <h1 class="title">Project Overview</h1>
            <p class="body-text">This project aims to address the challenges faced by students preparing to move in or
                move out in for further studies and often find themselves burdened with unused items when moving out of
                colleges. Similarly, incoming students struggle to find affordable necessities. The solution is to
                develop an app facilitating the buying, selling, and donation of used items among students.</p>

        <section id="problem-statement">
            <h1 class="title">Problem statement</h1>
            <p class="body-text">While younger students look for educational materials, older students in a college try
                to sell or give
                them before leaving. The deficiency of an effective platform necessitates a solution that makes
                transactions within the educational community smooth.</p>

            <p class="body-text">Through thorough research on buying and selling second-hand products, I empathized with
                users by understanding their needs for affordability and sustainability, identifying challenges such as
                trust issues and pricing concerns, recognizing behaviors like online preference and negotiation tactics.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">This involved review of exciting platforms like SUNOBOOKFLICK website and relevant
                online content related to buying and selling of products. These are the insights of the research

                        table, mattresses, kitchen utensils, etc</li>
                    <li>Users who are newcomers aren’t aware of the right places to buy basic stuff so they want an
                        affordable and convenient way to buy stuff.</li>
                    <li>User needs a trust worthy platform which has proper details about items and sellers.</li>

            <p class="body-text">I proceeded to conduct interviews to explore about the individuals who are currently
                studying or recent graduates. These interviews were designed to understand more about the user behaviors
                and expectation while selling and buying.</p>

            <p class="body-text">After user interviews an affinity mapping process was done to analyze and organize the
                available data. I organized the data into Pain points, Exchange mode, Pricing, Use cases, Expected
                features. This helped me under important pain points and design the app to solve these pain points.</p>

                master’s degrees beyond that. After gathering data, I discovered that the target audience is between
                17–25 age.</p>
            <p class="body-text">Using the gather data I understood the major pain points, expectations and goals of the
                target audience, then I created user personas for both buyer and seller. These personas helped me design
                the app with better user experience.</p>

            <p class="body-text">With the initial prototype which were ready for testing, the participants were given
                specific tasks to complete, such as listing a product for sale, searching for a pair Nike shoes,
                negotiating with a seller, or add a product to wishlist. And as they navigated through the app, I
                observed their interactions and noted any areas of confusion or difficulty.</p>
            <p class="body-text">
                By the end of the testing sessions, I had gathered valuable insights from participants and identified
                several areas for improvement. Which include change of icon for delete, addition for new screen customer
                support, change in label for product available in, rename the app to [Student swap].</p>
