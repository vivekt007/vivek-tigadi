            <h1 class="title">Project Overview</h1>
            <p class="body-text">In this platform, students can select a job profile relevant to them. Based on the job
                profile selected, they can see relevant interview questions, to which they can record their responses in
                a video format. On submission, they can get automated feedback on their pace of speech, accuracy, filler
                words, sensitive phrases & narration from the system. </p>

        <section id="user-personas">
            <h1 class="title">Research</h1>
            <p class="body-text">I conducted research by exploring related websites and apps to gather insights into
                existing interview preparation platforms. After analyzing their features and user experiences, I framed
                questions to understand users' preferences and pain points. Additionally, I interviewed friends to
                gather firsthand feedback on their interview preparation experiences, allowing me to tailor the
                application to address real user needs.</p>
            <p class="body-text">This research helped me build a persona which i used as a reference to design the app.

        <section id="info-architecture">
            <h1 class="title">User flows</h1>
            <p class="body-text">I mapped out the steps users would take from selecting a topic to receiving feedback on
                their recorded responses. I organized actions logically, ensuring intuitive navigation. This involved
                determining main screens, transitions, and simplifying steps where possible. </p>

            <p class="body-text">Using the flow I created Information architecture which includes all possible screens
                and actions the user might need to prepare for his/her interview.</p>

            <h1 class="title">Wireframes</h1>
            <p class="body-text">After understanding the user flows, information architecture, and goals, I created
                wireframes by sketching layouts of key screens and functionalities. I ensured consistency with user
                flows and prioritized content based on user needs. Iterative refinement was done to enhance usability
                and clarity, setting the foundation for the app's design.</p>
